###### Now with readme!

The _Cisco Networking Academy: Routing and Switching Essentials_ (CCNA2) course covers key topics for the CCNA certification exam. Alongside most of them, Cisco IOS commands for Cisco routers and switches are presented.

This project aims to gather all the course's switch and router commands in a space where everyone (not just _Netacad_ learners) can refer to such commands.

Aiming to be useful, easy to read, and provide as many valuable information to learners and professionals as possible:  

Commands are organized by topic,

## Motivation

While the initial aim of this repository was
- To gather all the commands found throughout the CCNA2 course in one place
- To help myself to master the commands, and learn more deeply about them and Cisco IOS in order to provide up-to-date and clear information in this space

I'm now convinced the project can grow further with constant work and research, and go beyond the scope of only the CCNA2 course in terms of the commands gathered.
